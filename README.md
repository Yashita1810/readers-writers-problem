Readers-Writers problem is a problem of process synchronization in operating systems. Here, a file is shared between many people. If one person edits the file, then no other person should be reading or writing at the same time. Otherwise, if a person is reading a file, then other people may also read it at the same time. In the first readers-writers problem, Readers are given more priority over writers. So, the writers starve. In second readers-writers problem, No writer should wait in the queue than necessary time. So here writers are given more priority and eventually readers starve. Therefore, in third readers-writers problem the solution is such that none of the readers or writers are given priority.This is a starve free solution.
